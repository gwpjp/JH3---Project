Much of this is derived from the author’s original ‘feature_info.txt’ file and more information is located there.

The features come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. The time domain signals were prefixed 't' to denote time.  The frequency domain signals were prefixed ‘f’ to denote frequency. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Many variables were estimated for these signals, but the reduced data set provides only those for:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
